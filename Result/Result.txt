1. 2Freq_Stationary_floating_with_code
Worked on the UCRStationary_1000s data set. 
The recorded data is [start_time, start_time+buff_size, ...
    n, sqrt(norm(N1)^2/length(N1)), error1, std1, sqrt(norm(N2)^2/length(N2)), ...
    error2, std2, sqrt(norm(N3)^2/length(N2)), error3, std3 ];
error1, std1 are from int-free smoothing. error2, std2 are from miles, with only the init cond, ins
and the wide lane and L1 phase considered. error3, std3 are from floating smoothing, all meas considered
including wide lane and L1 phase.
